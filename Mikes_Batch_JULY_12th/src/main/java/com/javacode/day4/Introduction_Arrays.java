public class Introduction_Arrays {

	
	//Array is an object that holds a fixed number of values of homogeneous or similar data-type
	//Array is a data structure where we store similar elements
	//length of an array is determined at the time of creation and once created, the length of the array is fixed
	//indexing position of an array starts with zero 0-9999
	
	//Features if array
	//1. a java array variable can be declared like other variables with []
	//2. the variable in the array are ordered
	//3.index starts with zero
	//4. Arrays are objects so they occupy heap memory space
	//5. the direct superclass of an array type is object
	//6. arrays are always created at runtime
	//7. length of an array can be determined using the member length
	//8. the elements of an array are stored in consecutive memory locations
	
	
	//Disadvantages of Array
	//1. Fixed size
	//2. Memory Wastage
	//3. Strongly typed
	//4. Reduce performance
	//5. Arrays do not have any add or remove methods
	
	
	//Advantages
	//1. Store multiple items using a single name
	//2. we can access any element randomly by using indexes provided by the arrays
	//3. arrays can be used to implement other data structures like LinkedLists, Stacks, quees, trees, graphs
	//4. Primitive type to wrapper classes object conversion will not happen in  case of arrays, so it is faster
